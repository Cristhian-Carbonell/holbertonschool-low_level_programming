#### man or help

* ```ascii``` (*You do not need to learn about ```scanf```, ```getc```, ```getchar```, ```EOF```, ```EXIT_SUCCESS```, ```time```, ```rand```, ```srand```, ```RAND_MAX```, ```for``` loops, ```do...while``` loops, functions.*)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/), **without the help of Google:**

### General

* What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
* What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
* What the the relational operators and how to use them
* What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
* What are the boolean operators and how to use them
* How to use the ```if```, ```if ... else``` statements
* How to use comments
* How to declare variables of types ```char```, ```int```, ```unsigned int```
* How to assign values to variables
* How to print the values of variables of type ```char```, ```int```, ```unsigned int``` with ```printf```
* How to use the ```while``` loop
* How to use variables with the ```while``` loop
* How to print variables using ```printf```
* What is the ```ASCII``` character set
* What are the purpose of the ```gcc``` flags ```-m32``` and ```-m64```

## Requirements

### General

* Allowed editors: ```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Your programs and functions will compiled with ```gcc 4.8.4``` using the flags ```-Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic```
* All your files should end with a new line
* A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project
* There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
* You are not allowed to use ```system```
* Your code should use the ```Betty``` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
