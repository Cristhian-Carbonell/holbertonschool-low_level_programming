## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/), **without the help of Google:**

### General

* How to use arguments passed to your program
* What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
* How to use ```__attribute__((unused))``` or ```(void)``` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

## Requirements

### General

* Allowed editors: ```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Your programs and functions will be compiled with ```gcc 4.8.4``` using the flags ```-Wall``` ```-Werror``` ```-Wextra``` and ```-pedantic```
* All your files should end with a new line
* A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the ```Betty``` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function ```_putchar``` should be included in your header file called ```holberton.h```
* Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
* You are allowed to use the standard library
